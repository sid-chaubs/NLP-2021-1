This notebook provides some examples how to query BERT.
It was developed by Lisa Beinborn for the course "Natural Language Processing Technologies" at VU Amsterdam.

It is based on the examples in the huggingface transformer documentation and requires the packages torch, transformers, numpy, and scipy.

For the visualization, I used matplotlib and seaborn. 
 
For the assignment, you will have to adapt this code.
